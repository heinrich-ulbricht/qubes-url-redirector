      <h1> Welcome! </h1>
      Hi, and thanks for installing <b>Open in Qube</b>! This page will help you to use this extension effectively. <br>
      "Open in Qube" is a browser extension that <em>block and eventually redirect to another qube, URLs that doesn't match against a <a href="#whitelist">whitelist</a> entry</em>.

      <article id="toolbar_button">
	<h2> Usage: Toolbar button </h2>
        The browser toolbar button has two functions:
        <ul>
          <li> It warns you, with a <span class="dangerous">red icon</span>, if the extension is not ready or some fatal error occurs. In the latter case reload the extension. </li>
          <li> It allows you to access the <a href="#settings">settings</a> page with a click. </li>
      </article>

      <article id="settings">
	<h2> Usage: Settings </h2>
	Through the settings page you can customize how the extension handle non whitelisted URLs. By default it simply blocks the request. However it could redirect to a disposable qube or to a default one. Furthermore it could be disabled completely. <br>
	Here a screenshot of the settings section that rule with this behavior:

      </article>

      <article id="whitelist">
	<h2> Usage: Whitelist </h2>
	The whitelist is the most critical part of the extension. It allows you to specify if an URL will be opened in the <em>current qube</em>. Furthermore you can assign a descriptive label and a trust level to the whitelist entries. <br>
	Initially the whitelist is empty. So <em>every</em> URL will be blocked. For this reason before you start to surf the web you should start to populate the whitelist. <br>
	The whitelist is accessible through the settings page and its entries are of three types. <br>
	The three types of entries are:
	<ul>
	  <li> RegExp </li>
	  <li> Exact Match </li>
	  <li> URL </li>
	</ul>
	Every entry type affects how an URL will be matched. <br>
	<section>
	  <h3> The "RegExp" type </h3>
	  This is the most flexible type. In fact you can describe, through JavaScript RegExp, whitelisted URL(s). Special careful should be used while defining an entry of this type. Remember that if an URL is matched against a whitelist entry it will be opened in the <strong>current Qube</strong>.

	  Here a screenshot of the input fields:
	<img class="entry" src="../screenshots/entry_type/regexp.png" alt="The &quot;RegExp&quot; type has only one input field through you can insert the JavaScript RegExp.">
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h3> The "Exact Match" type </h3>
	  This is the most restrictive type. In fact with this type you can specify a string that will be matched against an URL if and only if they are equally.

	  Here a screenshot of the input fields:
	<img class="entry" src="../screenshots/entry_type/exact_match.png" alt="The &quot;Exact Match&quot; type has only one input field through you can insert the string.">
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h3> The "URL" type </h3>
	  This type allows you to add an entry specifying URL's componenent. Specifically:
	  <ul>
	    <li> Scheme, http or https. It's optional. </li>
	    <li> Host, it supports: IPv4, IPv6 and DNS name </li>
	    <li> Port. It's optional </li>
	    <li> Pathname, query string and fragment. It's optional </li>
	  </ul>
	  <br>
